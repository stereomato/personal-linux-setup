# personal-linux-setup

Stereomato's (me), well, personal linux setup. 

It's messy atm, I need to make it better and nicer, but it... works. For me.

I used to be on NixOS, but I no longer am due to personal reasons, which is why this is messy.

# TODO
1. Improve set up scripts (aka install.fish files).
2. Find or make a way to uh handle system stuff better. Currently I use cp -aZ to copy files on the system folder to well, linux system folders. This is not cool, as if I forget about doing that after editing any file there, changes aren't actually applied.
